🪞 Into the Mirror-verse

🚀 Overview
Welcome, Voyager! You are aboard the spaceship Five Alive, drifting through the strange and mysterious Mirror-verse. A cryptic message has appeared on the screen—it’s your only clue to finding your way home.

Unfortunately, the message is encrypted. Your mission is to decode it by solving the following challenge.

🎯 Your Mission
Your task is to write a function that processes the given encrypted string to reveal the hidden message.

📝 Requirements:
Reverse the string: The message is backwards—you need to flip it.
Normalize the message:
Convert all letters to lowercase.
Remove all characters except alphabetic letters (no spaces, numbers, or symbols).
Return the decoded message: Once processed, the function should reveal the final message.

🧪 Example Input and Output
Input	Output
'edoclatropehtdnif'	Revealed message
'ed!o@c#la%rto^pe&ht*dn(if'	Revealed message
' EDOC LARTOPEHT DNIF '	Revealed message



✅ How to Test
The tests for your function are already written. To verify your solution, run the tests in your terminal. If all tests pass, you’ll find the hidden message.

🧪 Test Scenarios
Basic reversal: Verify that the string is reversed and returned in lowercase.
Special character removal: Ensure the result only contains letters from the alphabet.
Space and number removal: Eliminate unnecessary spaces and numbers.


🛠️ Instructions
Open the reverseString function file.
Implement the function logic to satisfy the requirements.
Run the tests using the following command:

npm run test

Once all tests pass, scroll up in the terminal to find the hidden message.

⚠️ Rules
Do not hardcode the output—your function must work with any valid input string.
Focus on readability and efficiency: Write clean, maintainable code.
Enjoy the challenge: Have fun decoding the mystery!
Good luck, Voyager. Decode the message, and find your way home! 🛸✨
